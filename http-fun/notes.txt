Uniform Resource Identifier
  - A sequence of characters that identifies resources.
  - No limit on the nature of the resource or reason for ID'ing resource.
  - Is essentially the idea of having an address (or ID) for shit on a network
    so that things in that network can see the resource.
  - Interpretation of a URI is consistent regardless of context. That interpretation
    is up to the implementation of the end user though.

  - Generic syntax of a URI are as follows (RFC3986)
      URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
      hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
                  / path-absolute
                  / path-rootless
                  / path-empty
  authority   = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
  userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )
  host        = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
  *look at RFC3989-3.2.2.Host for more host info*
  port        = *DIGIT


  - Example URI
    foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
