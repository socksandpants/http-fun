#HTTP/1.1 server in C

This is an HTTP/1.1 server that runs over an open port on a Debian system.

> An HTTP "server" is a program that accepts connections in order to service HTTP
> requests by sending HTTP responses. (RFC9110)

All that is needed to compile and run this server is either a version of gcc that supports
C17. If for some reason you are not able to use gcc the Makefile is given and the program is simple enough for you to change the compiler options easily.
